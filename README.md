# Seismic_scripts Repository

## The Following Jupyter notebook contains numerous seismic python scripts that can aid with Geophysical programming/research.

### The first set of scripts is designed to fabricate and analyze spectral ratio data across IRIS' mustang web request network. The second set of scripts is a variety of .sac file utilities that can aid in measuring sensor performance. The third script is designed to web request seismic response data from .XML files in a similar way to the first script. 

# Geophysics rocks! :)
