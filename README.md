# Seismic_scripts Repository

## The Following Jupyter notebook contains numerous seismic python scripts that can aid with Geophysical programming/research.

### The first set of scripts is designed to fabricate and analyze spectral ratio data across IRIS' mustang web request network. The second set of scripts is a variety of .sac file utilities that can aid in measuring sensor performance. There is some data collected from SWARM to accompany this part of the seismic scripts notebook. The third script is designed to web request seismic response data from .XML files in a similar way to the first script. 

# Geophysics rocks! :)
